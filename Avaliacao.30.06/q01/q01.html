        New York City has the world's two largest stock exchanges and is known for
        having some of the world's most renowned educational facilities.

        <h2>Times Square</h2>
        <p>
        Formerly named Longacre
        Square, it was renamed in April
        1904 after the New York Times
        moved its headquarters to the
        Times Building, now called One
        Times Square.

        Just like the rest of New York
        City, Central Park has been
        featured in over 350 films and
        counting over the years. That's
        why it holds the title of most
        filmed public park in the world.

        Nicknames include 'The
        Crossroads of the World' and
        reportedly 'The Tenderloin'
        because it was supposedly the
        most desirable location in
        Manhattan in the 1920s.
